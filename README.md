# Hungarian-Murty
Implementation of Murty's 1968 algorithm to find k best costs of a given assignment matrix (http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.16.3.682)
The algorithm can work with any algorithm to find best cost in principle but in this case the hungarian method implementation by Lars Buitinck  has been used.
